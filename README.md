# Data🚀 Data Analytics with Python: Customer Transactions & Product Insights 📊
I recently worked on an end-to-end data analysis project using Python, where I explored customer transactions, product hierarchy, and purchasing patterns. This project involved data cleaning, merging multiple datasets, generating summary reports, and visualizing key insights.

🔍 Key Highlights of the Project:
✅ Data Preprocessing: Read and cleaned datasets for customer details, transactions, and product hierarchy
✅ Merging & Transformation: Combined datasets for a structured view of customer purchases
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Extracted insights on top-selling products, customer demographics, and purchase trends
✅ Visualization: Used Matplotlib for plotting trends to uncover meaningful patterns

🛠 Technologies Used:
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
🔹 Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering
🔹 Jupyter Notebook for structured workflow

📂 Project Structure:
1️⃣ Reading & Cleaning Data: Processed customer and product files
2️⃣ Data Merging: Combined transactions with customer details
3️⃣ Summary Reports: Extracted key statistics & insights
4️⃣ Visualization: Analyzed customer behavior and sales trends
